What is Proboscis?
-----------------
Proboscis is a tiny java library for polling for a result, originally intended for tested
asynchronous systems. It separates out the concept of *Probing*, taking a snapshot of the current
state, from the activity of polling and managing timeouts.

Proboscis can be considered a [hamcrest extension][]

Downloads
---------
You can obtain Proboscis binaries from [Maven central][]

Issues can be reported using [GitHub issue tracker][]
